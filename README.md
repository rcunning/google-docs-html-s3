# google-docs-html-s3

[Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) that publishes a Google Doc to Amazon S3 as a HTML file. 

Adapted from https://github.com/liddiard/google-sheet-s3.

## Setup

- See S3 setup in https://github.com/liddiard/google-sheet-s3/blob/master/README.md

- Since the script is not published in the marketplace, you will need to create the script in your doc (copy in publish.gs into the main script, and add config.html). You will also need to install the S3 library (Resource menu) - see https://engetc.com/projects/amazon-s3-api-binding-for-google-apps-script/.
